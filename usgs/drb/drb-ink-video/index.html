        <p>When rain falls and snow melts in parts of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, the water trickles over and through the ground into streams. Those streams combine into tributaries, and eventually come together as the Delaware River which flows over 300 miles from head-to-mouth all the way the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean.</p>

        <p>The Delaware River – named the 2020 River of the Year by American Rivers for its rich history and thriving communities – forms a main artery that drains the river basin and connects all the people, cities, industries, and ecosystems around it. </p>

        <p>Throughout its history, the Delaware River Basin has been a crucible of competing interests and water needs, and a clear example of the complex interplay between water quality and quantity.</p>

        <p>So how has the management of such an extensive river basin possible?</p>

        <h4>[ Begin Uses Chapter ]</h4> 
        <p>Balancing the just needs of the people and ecosystems in the Basin to get enough water has been the focus of years of research, collaboration among federal, state, and local water management groups, and even a Supreme Court decision. A 1954 ruling gave guidelines for how much water NYC is allowed to divert, as well as how much water has to be allowed to flow at two important checkpoints along its way to the ocean.</p>

        <h4>[ Vis of release decisions, maybe a Sankey, positioned beneath scrolling text ]</h4>

        <p>The River Master – a position established by the ruling – relies on rainfall and streamflow data collected by hundreds of USGS-affiliated monitoring stations through the basin to calculate how much water is stored or released from the reservoirs along its tributaries.</p>
