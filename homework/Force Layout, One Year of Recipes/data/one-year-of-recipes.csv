frank cisneros says this is probably the most popular cocktail he's ever made; it was on the menu at gin palace in new york's east village for years. upon first taste, you'll see why it was such a crowd-pleaser. it's a sunny, warming drink, thanks to pineapple's heady tropical flavor and a spicy cinnamon simple syrup, all perked up with grapefruit, lime, and piney gin. 
 -- 
there's no need to get out a juicer for this; just muddle a 2- to 3-inch chunk of fresh pineapple and strain through a fine-mesh strainer into your measuring cup or jigger. this drink would be totally at home at a tiki party; you can multiply the recipe (and make fresh pineapple juice by whirring chopped fruit in your blender, then straining), but don't try to shake more than two drinks at a time.","gin,cinnamon syrup,fresh pineapple juice,fresh lime juice,grapefruit juice,water,sugar,cinnamon sticks",8

i adore this fragrant and refreshing strawberry-gin drink, created by shannon tebay sidle of new york's slowly shirley and death & co. the secret ingredient is a dollop of unsweetened greek yogurt, which gives the cocktail a tangy flavor and subtly creamy texture. the final result isn't sweet or smoothie-like; this is definitely still a cocktail. a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper highlights the gin's herbal character, but i also like this drink with grassy blanco tequila or a full-bodied aged rum. if your fridge doesn't dispense crushed ice, fill a freezer bag with cubes, wrap them in a dish towel, and go wild with a meat tenderizer or rolling pin.","strawberries,honey,gin,greek yogurt,fresh ground black pepper,strawberry",6
