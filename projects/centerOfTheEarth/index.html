            <h2>To the Center of the Earth</h2>
            <p id="intro">Like all terrestrial planets, the Earth's interior is differentiated. This means that its internal structure consists of layers, arranged like the skin of an onion.<br><br>Peel back one layer and you find another, distinguished from the last by its physical and chemical properties, as well as vast differences in temperature and pressure.  But how far really is it to get all the way to the center?
