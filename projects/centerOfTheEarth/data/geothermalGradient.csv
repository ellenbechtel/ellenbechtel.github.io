The rocks begin to warm up, and most earthquakes originate here.  The lithosphere below the solid, relatively cold base of each tectonic plate that floats on top of the fluid asthenosphere below."

Above, everything is rigid  (lithos = rock), and in this layer, everything flows like goo (astheno = weak). This is a mechanically, physically different layer, even though the chemical composition is the same above and below.  "

Earthquakes create a few kinds of waves, and as they “ring” around the planet, ones of a certain type suddenly disappear once they pass through this depth, suggesting that the material here changes from solid to liquid.
