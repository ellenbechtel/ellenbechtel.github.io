                <p class="prose"><span class="emphasize">Springtime in North America means sexy time for birds.</span> They fly back north to their breeding grounds across the US and get it on, and birders across the continent break out their binoculars to peep on the returning birds and their offspring.</p>
                <p class="prose"><span class="emphasize">The North American Breeding Bird Survey</span> (BBS) was
                        established in 1966 by Chandler S. Robbins in the wake of
                        Rachel Carson's book <i>Silent Spring</i> which highlighted the effects of pesticides on wildlife populations. 
                        Chandler realized that nobody had any reliable large-scale
                        data on changes in the populations of many bird species,
                        especially songbirds. The BBS now provides the most reliable regional 
                        and continental trends and annual indices of abundance available for over 500 bird species continent-wide.</p>
                <p class="prose">The BBS was one of the first citizen science programs; it relies
                        on thousands of highly skilled birders, most of whom are
                        volunteers, to undertake roadside surveys across the North
                        American continent during the peak breeding season - between May and early July, depending on latitude.</p>
                <p class="prose">Volunteers trace a route made up of fifty 3-min stations rougly 0.8 km apart on secondary roads. A single observer identifies
                        and counts every bird they see within 400 m of their stop, or record any bird heard at any distance. The counts are then compiled the 
                        United States Geological Survey (USGS) Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland and made available to the public.</p>

                <p class="prose">In the last 50+ years, we've learned a lot from these samplings. he Breeding Bird Survey is used in all sorts of ornithological studies.  The data are publicly available for use and are updated regularly.
                    By 2009, was used in a <a href="https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/about/bbsbib.pdf">gajillion peer-reviewed scientific studies.</a> The information is publically available, but is SO dense and hard to get a sense of. So let's look at it a little differently.</p>

                        <span class="latinName">Passeriformes</span>.  They are blackbirds that look like they've been slightly stretched, and they have 
                        glossy, iridescent bodies.  They walk around on lawns and fields on their long legs, or gather in noisy groups high in trees. They'll eat almost 
                        anything, including trash and corn crops. They live in Massachusetts year-round, and they're kinda everywhere.</p>
                    <p class="prose">It was one of 183 different species spotted in Massachusetts over the 50 years of the BBS.</p>
                    <p class="prose"><span class="emphasize">Data from the BBS shows that grackle populations are in steep decline,
                    with populations shrinking 2% per year, and down 58% since the survey began in 1966.</span></p>
