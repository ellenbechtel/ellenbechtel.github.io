
The Weather file (Weather.zip) contains the following columns:

 RouteDataID 		Data identification number; unique for each unique combination of countrynum region, route, RPID, and year.

 CountryNum  		The three digit code that identifies country where route is located (See RegionCodes file.).

 StateNum    		The two digit numerical code that identifies the state, province, or territory where the route is located (See RegionCodes file.).

 Route       		The three digit code that identifies the route.

 RPID	     		The run protocol identification number.  Identifies protocol used to sample route (See RunProtocolID file.).

 Year        		The year. The CountryNum, StateNum, Route, RPID, and Year columns uniquely identify a 
	     		run of a route.

 Month       		The month the route was run (1-12).

 Day         		The day the route was run (1-31).

 ObsN        		Unique observer identification number.

 TotalSpp    		The total number of species recorded on that run of the route.

 StartTemp   		The temperature recorded at the beginning of the run of the route.

 EndTemp     		The temperature recorded at the end of the run of the route.

 TempScale   		The scale in which the temperatures were recorded. F stands for Fahrenheit; 
	     		C stands for Celcius.

 StartWind   		The Beaufort wind speed code recorded at the beginning of the run of the route (See WeatherCodes file.).

 EndWind     		The Beaufort wind speed code recorded at the end of the run of the route (See WeatherCodes file.).

 StartSky    		The Weather Bureau sky code recorded at the beginning of the run of the route (See WeatherCodes file.).

 EndSky      		The Weather Bureau sky code recorded at the end of the run of the route (See WeatherCodes file.).

 StartTime   		The time the run of the route began, recorded in 24 hour local time.

 EndTime     		The time the run of the route ended, recorded in 24 hour local time.

 Assistant   		If someone assisted the observer by recording the data, then this column 
	     		is 1, otherwise it is 0.

 QualityCurrentID	Indicates whether the route sampling event (i.e., run) took place under suitable weather conditions and within suitable time, 
			date, and route completion criteria. If data meet criteria, then QualityCurrentID is 1, otherwise it is 0 (See RunType file.).

 RunType     		The RunType code helps to quickly determine which data do, or do not meet the BBS program’s data criteria.  
			A RunType code of 1 is assigned whenever data were collected under conditions that meet BBS weather, date, time, and route completion 
			criteria (QualityCurrentID = 1) on a randomly established route (i.e., RouteTypeDetailID = 1) using the official BBS
			sampling protocol (RunProtocolID = 101).

			Conversely, a RunType code of 0 indicates that data from a run fail to meet one or more of the aforementioned requirements.  This could 
			occur in one of 3 scenarios, or in combination, when: data exceed suitable date, time, weather, and/or route completion 
			criteria (QualityCurrentID = 0), data had been collected along a non-randomly established route (i.e., RouteTypeDetailID is not 1), and/or 
			when the official BBS sampling protocol had not been used or it is a replicate run (RunProtocolID is not 101; See RunType file.).


There is one record in the Weather file for every run of a route per year.
