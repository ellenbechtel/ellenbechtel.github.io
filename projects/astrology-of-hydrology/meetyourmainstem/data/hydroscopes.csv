Charles River,"The Native name for the Charles River is ""Quinobequin"", which means ""meandering""; this river doubles back on itself several times. The nation's very first mills and industrial canals were diverted from it. The Charles River directly supported a booming economy, but at the price of its purity; efforts to improve the water quality of the river persist today, and swimmers may not enter it without a special permit. Despite taking what others may consider to be a meandering route, you are a very productive person.
